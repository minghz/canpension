Calculator for OAS/GIS

The goal of this website is to bring transparency and simplicity into obtaining the OAS and GIS amounts for Canadian Pensioners.

Partial OAS receipients may find slight discrepancies over the total receivable GIS.

This website is not sponsored by the Canadian government. The calculations here serve as reference only, with data taken from the official Government of Canada websites. Reference links can be found on this site for further context.

# How does it work?
1. Crawl through Gov. webpages to agregate table data
2. Implement receivable GIS lookup logic for each case scenario

# Deployment
`yarn deploy` aided by `gh-pages` package - needs special permissions
